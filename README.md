# Smart Parking System for a Smart Campus Proposal
![Proposal for Smart Campus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93007427/210375927-1504e194-b629-463c-b9c7-caf9e8ddc681.jpeg)

This proposal is for a Smart Parking System that utilizes information and communication technologies to automate parking lots and provide unmanned services. The system aims to address the challenges faced by car drivers or owners in finding parking spaces, avoiding blind parking, improving parking efficiency, improving the utilization of traffic roads, and alleviating traffic congestion.


## Introduction
As the demand for parking lots increases, security awareness becomes more critical. The development of new technologies such as information and communication has led to the increasing automation of parking lots, and unmanned services have become the norm. The Smart Parking Mobile Application for Parking System has realized networked data sharing through network platforms.


## Objectives
The primary objective of the Smart Parking System is to solve the problem of car driver or owner difficulties in finding parking spaces. Additionally, it aims to improve parking efficiency, avoid blind parking, improve the utilization of the traffic road, and alleviate the traffic congestion.


## Subsystems
The Smart Parking System consists of multiple subsystems that adopt technologies of the Smart Parking Application for Parking System with the help of information technology. These subsystems include:

1. `Parking Management System`: This system is responsible for managing and monitoring the availability of parking spaces. It utilizes sensors to detect the presence of vehicles and provides real-time data on the availability of parking spaces.

2. `Mobile Application`: The Smart Parking Mobile Application allows users to view the availability of parking spaces and reserve a parking spot in advance.

3. `Payment System`: The Payment System allows users to pay for parking fees through the mobile application, making the payment process more convenient and hassle-free.

4. `Security System`: The Security System ensures the safety of the parking lot by utilizing cameras to monitor the parking area and alerting authorities in case of any suspicious activities.


## Conclusion
The Smart Parking System is an innovative solution that utilizes information and communication technologies to automate parking lots and provide unmanned services. This system has the potential to revolutionize the parking industry by providing real-time data on the availability of parking spaces and improving parking efficiency. The proposed system can be implemented in Smart Campuses to provide a hassle-free parking experience for students, staff, and visitors.
